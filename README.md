### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD researcher at King's College London, specializing in spatial audio, immersive audio, sound field reconstruction, and exploring AI+Music topics as a hobby, particularly symbolic music for jazz.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 
  - Room acoustics simulation
  - Generative models for spatial audio reproduction
  - DL for Music

Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on DL+Audio or Spatial Audio topics.
